# Multi-Environment GitHub Setup - Orchestrator

This document outlines the steps to set up a multi-environment workflow to deploy the orchestrator service to Azure using GitHub Actions, taking the solution from proof of concept to production-ready.

> [!NOTE]
> Note that additional steps not currently covered in this guide may be required when working with the Zero Trust Architecture Deployment to handle deploying to a network-isolated environment.

# Decisions required:

- Service Principals that will be used for each environment
- Whether to use federated identity or client secret for authentication
- Decisions on which GitHub repository, Azure subscription, and Azure location to use

# Prerequisites:

- Assumes that the infrastructure creation is already completed using the guidance in the [GPT-RAG]() directory.
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?tabs=azure-cli)
- [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd?tabs=winget-windows%2Cbrew-mac%2Cscript-linux&pivots=os-windows)
- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)
- [PowerShell 7](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.4)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Bash shell (e.g., Git Bash)
- GitHub organization with the [ability to provision environments](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs-and-deployments/managing-deployments/managing-environments-for-deployment) (e.g., GitHub Enterprise)
- Personnel with the following access levels:
  - In Azure: Either Owner role or Contributor + User Access Administrator roles within the Azure subscription, which provides the ability to create and assign roles to a Service Principal
  - In GitHub: Repository owner access, which provides the ability to create environments and variables/secrets

# Steps:

> [!NOTE]
>
> 1. All commands below are to be run in a Bash shell.
> 2. This guide aims to provide automated/programmatic steps for pipeline setup where possible. Manual setup is also possible, but not covered extensively in this guide. Please read more about manual pipeline setup [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/blob/main/cli/azd/docs/manual-pipeline-config.md).

## 1. Create azd environments & Service Principals

### Setup

`cd` to the root of the repo. Before creating environments, you need to define the environment names. Note that these environment names are reused as the GitHub environment names later.

```bash
dev_env='<dev-env-name>' # Example: dev
test_env='<test-env-name>' # Example: test
prod_env='<prod-env-name>' # Example: prod
```

Next, define the names of the Service Principals that will be used for each environment. You will need the name in later steps.

```bash
dev_principal_name='<dev-sp-name>'
test_principal_name='<test-sp-name>'
prod_principal_name='<prod-sp-name>'
```

Login to Azure:

```bash
az login
```

## 2. Set up GitHub Environments

### Environment setup

Set up initial variables:

```bash
org='<your-org-name>'
repo='<your-repo-name>'

subscription_id=$(az account show --query "id" --output tsv)
rg_location='<your-resource group-location>'

```

Run GitHub CLI commands to create the environments:

```bash
gh auth login

gh api --method PUT -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" repos/$org/$repo/environments/$dev_env
gh api --method PUT -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" repos/$org/$repo/environments/$test_env
gh api --method PUT -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" repos/$org/$repo/environments/$prod_env
```

### Variables setup

Configure the repository and environment variables: Delete the `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` and `AZURE_ENV_NAME` variables at the repository level as they aren't needed and only represent what was set for the environment you created last. `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` will be reconfigured at the environment level, and `AZURE_ENV_NAME` will be passed as an input to the deploy job.

<!-- Are the below steps are necessary? -->

```bash
gh variable delete AZURE_CLIENT_ID
gh variable delete AZURE_ENV_NAME
```

Get the client IDs of the Service Principals you created. Ensure you previously ran `az login`.

```bash
dev_client_id=$(az ad sp list --display-name $dev_principal_name --query "[].appId" --output tsv)
test_client_id=$(az ad sp list --display-name $test_principal_name --query "[].appId" --output tsv)
prod_client_id=$(az ad sp list --display-name $prod_principal_name --query "[].appId" --output tsv)
```

> [!NOTE] > _Alternative approach to get the client IDs in the above steps:_
> In the event that there are multiple Service Principals containing the same name, the `az ad sp list` command executed above may not pull the correct ID. You may execute an alternate command to manually review the list of Service Principals by name and ID. The command to do this is exemplified below for the dev environment.
>
> ```bash
> az ad sp list --display-name $dev_principal_name --query "[].{DisplayName:displayName, > AppId:appId}" --output table # return results in a table format
> dev_client_id='<guid>' # manually assign the correct client ID
> ```
>
> Also note you may get the client IDs from the Azure Portal.

Set up initial variables:

```bash
TENANT_ID=$(az ad sp show --id $dev_client_id --query "appOwnerOrganizationId" --output tsv)
SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$(az account show --query "id" --output tsv)
SUBSCRIPTION_NAME=$(az account show --query "name" --output tsv)
```

Set these values as variables at the environment level:

```bash
gh variable set AZURE_CLIENT_ID -b $dev_client_id -e $dev_env
gh variable set AZURE_CLIENT_ID -b $test_client_id -e $test_env
gh variable set AZURE_CLIENT_ID -b $prod_client_id -e $prod_env
```

Set these values as variables at the repository level:

```bash
gh variable set AZURE_LOCATION -b $rg_location
gh variable set AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID -b $SUBSCRIPTION_ID
gh variable set AZURE_TENANT_ID -b $TENANT_ID
```

> [!TIP]
> After environments are created, consider setting up deployment protection rules for each environment. See [this article](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/administering-github-actions/managing-environments-for-deployment#deployment-protection-rules) for more.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to manage and authenticate with a client secret rather than using federated identity, you would need to create a secret for each Service Principal, store it as an environment secret in GitHub, and modify the workflow to use the secret for authentication. This is not covered in this example. If you choose to use a client secret, you may skip 3.

## 3. Configure Azure Federated credentials to use newly set up GitHub environments

Run the following commands to create a federated credential within the Service Principals you created. These commands will enable authentication between GitHub and Azure for each environment.

```bash
issuer="https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
audiences="api://AzureADTokenExchange"

echo '{"name": "'"${org}-${repo}-${dev_env}"'", "issuer": "'"${issuer}"'", "subject": "repo:'"$org"'/'"$repo"':environment:'"$dev_env"'", "description": "'"${dev_env}"' environment", "audiences": ["'"${audiences}"'"]}' > federated_id.json
az ad app federated-credential create --id $dev_client_id --parameters ./federated_id.json

echo '{"name": "'"${org}-${repo}-${test_env}"'", "issuer": "'"${issuer}"'", "subject": "repo:'"$org"'/'"$repo"':environment:'"$test_env"'", "description": "'"${test_env}"' environment", "audiences": ["'"${audiences}"'"]}' > federated_id.json
az ad app federated-credential create --id $test_client_id --parameters ./federated_id.json

echo '{"name": "'"${org}-${repo}-${prod_env}"'", "issuer": "'"${issuer}"'", "subject": "repo:'"$org"'/'"$repo"':environment:'"$prod_env"'", "description": "'"${prod_env}"' environment", "audiences": ["'"${audiences}"'"]}' > federated_id.json
az ad app federated-credential create --id $prod_client_id --parameters ./federated_id.json

rm federated_id.json # clean up temp file
```

> [!NOTE]
> The existing/unmodified federated credentials created by Azure Developer CLI in the Service Principals may be deleted.

## 4. Modify the workflow files as needed for deployment

### Updating environment names

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - The environment names in the below described `azure-dev.yml` **need to be edited to match the environment names you created**.
> - The `workflow_dispatch` in the `azure-dev.yml` file is set to trigger on push to a branch `none`. You may modify this to trigger on a specific branch or event.

- The following files in the `.github/workflows` folder are used to deploy the service to Azure:
  - `azure-dev.yml`
    - This is the main file that triggers the deployment workflow. The environment names are passed as inputs to the deploy job.
  - `deploy-template.yml`
    - This is a template file invoked by `azure-dev.yml` that is used to deploy the service to Azure. This file needs to be edited if you are using client secret authentication.
